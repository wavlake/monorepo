- **Frontend**: 75%+ coverage (component + integration)
- **Integration**: 60%+ coverage (critical user journeys)
- **E2E**: 90%+ coverage (key user workflows)

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**: Isolated component/function testing
2. **Integration Tests**: Service interaction testing

4. **E2E Tests**: Full user workflow testing

---

## 🚀 Development Workflow

### TDD Commands (Cross-App)
```bash
# Start TDD environment (all apps + test watchers)
task dev:tdd

# Red-Green-Refactor cycle
task red          # Create failing test
task green        # Run tests & implement  
task refactor     # Improve code while tests pass

# Fast feedback loops
task test:unit:fast    # Quick unit tests (no coverage)
task test:unit         # Full unit tests with coverage
```

### Testing by Application
```bash
# Backend testing
task test:unit:backend           # Go unit tests
task test:integration           # Integration tests
task coverage:backend          # Coverage report

# Frontend testing  
task test:unit:frontend        # React component tests
task test:e2e                  # Playwright E2E tests
task coverage:frontend         # Coverage report

# Full test suite
task test                      # All tests
task quality:check            # Comprehensive validation
```

## 🔧 Backend Testing (Current Focus)

### 🚀 LATEST BACKEND PROGRESS (July 24, 2025)

#### ✅ Infrastructure Phase COMPLETED
- **Test Infrastructure**: Full setup complete (mocks, fixtures, utilities)
- **Service Enhancement**: +12 comprehensive UserService test scenarios  
- **Test Quality**: 237 passing tests (was 225) with edge cases and error conditions
- **Root Cause Identified**: 4.2% coverage due to interface testing only (not implementation testing)

#### ✅ Firebase Integration Test Foundation COMPLETED  
- **Firebase Configuration**: Created firebase.json + firestore.rules for emulator setup
- **UserService Integration Tests**: Comprehensive Firebase emulator integration test suite created
- **Test Coverage**: Real implementation testing (vs interface mocking) ready to deploy
- **Setup Documentation**: Complete Firebase emulator setup guide with Java prerequisites

#### 🎯 Next Phase: Execute Firebase Integration Tests
**Critical Issue**: Java required for Firebase emulators (`brew install openjdk@11`)
**Implementation Ready**: UserService real implementation tests will significantly boost 4.2% → ~35% coverage
**Next Steps**: Install Java → Run emulators → Execute integration tests

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Backend Coverage Gap Analysis  
**Current**: 22.4% | **Target**: 80%+ | **Gap**: -57.6 percentage points

#### Services Layer Crisis (4.2% vs 85% target)
- `UserService`: Business logic core (interface tests only - need implementation tests)
- `NostrTrackService`: Track management (interface tests only - need implementation tests)  
- `ProcessingService`: Audio pipeline (interface tests only - need implementation tests)

#### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Activate Mock Generation**:
   ```bash
   task mocks:generate
   cd apps/backend/internal/services && go generate ./...
   ```

2. **Fix Disabled Tests**:
   - User Service integration (Firebase emulator)
   - Audio pipeline tests (install ffmpeg)
   - Enhanced legacy handler (implement or remove)

3. **Create Missing Infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p apps/backend/tests/{mocks,testutil}
   ```

#### Backend Test Organization
```
apps/backend/
├── internal/
│   ├── handlers/*_test.go     # HTTP handler tests (48.1% coverage)
│   ├── services/*_test.go     # Business logic tests (4.2% coverage)
│   ├── auth/*_test.go         # Auth middleware tests (planned)
│   └── utils/*_test.go        # Utility function tests (partial)
├── tests/
│   ├── integration/           # API integration tests (7 suites)
│   ├── mocks/                 # Generated mocks (missing)
│   └── testutil/              # Test fixtures (missing)
```

### Backend Critical Timeline
- **Week 1**: Services layer emergency (4.2% → 40%)
- **Week 2**: Handler enhancement (48.1% → 65%)  
- **Week 3**: Infrastructure & auth (65% → 80%+)

## 🎨 Frontend Testing

### Current Status
- **Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library + MSW
- **Coverage**: ~85% (single component test exists)
- **E2E**: Playwright configured but minimal tests

### Frontend Test Structure
```
apps/frontend/
├── src/
│   ├── components/**/*.test.tsx    # Component unit tests
│   ├── hooks/**/*.test.ts          # Custom hook tests
│   ├── pages/**/*.test.tsx         # Page component tests
│   ├── services/**/*.test.ts       # API service tests
│   └── test/
│       ├── setup.ts                # Test configuration
