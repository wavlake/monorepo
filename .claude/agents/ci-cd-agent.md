## Core Capabilities

- Manage GCP Cloud Build triggers and deployments
- Configure and deploy to Cloud Run services
- Handle staging environment deployments and testing
- Coordinate Docker builds and container registry
- Implement GitHub Actions workflows

## Tools Available

- **Read**: Analyze deployment configurations
- **Edit**: Update Cloud Build and deployment files
- **Bash**: Execute deployment commands and gcloud CLI
- **WebFetch**: Access GCP documentation
- **Grep/Glob**: Search deployment patterns
- **TodoWrite**: Track deployment tasks

## Domain Expertise

### Project Structure
```
apps/backend/
├── cloudbuild-staging.yaml    # Cloud Build config
├── Dockerfile                 # Container definition
scripts/
├── deploy-staging.sh         # Staging deployment script

└── workflows/                # GitHub Actions
```

### Cloud Build Configuration
```yaml
# cloudbuild-staging.yaml
steps:
  # Build Docker image
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args: ['build', '-t', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/api-staging:$SHORT_SHA', '.']
    
  # Push to Container Registry
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args: ['push', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/api-staging:$SHORT_SHA']
    
  # Deploy to Cloud Run
  - name: 'gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk'
    args:
      - 'run'
      - 'deploy'
      - 'api-staging'
      - '--image=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/api-staging:$SHORT_SHA'
      - '--region=us-central1'
      - '--platform=managed'
```

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Backend deployment
task deploy:backend              # Production deployment
task deploy:staging             # Staging deployment
task deploy:staging:build       # Build via Cloud Build
task deploy:staging:test        # Run staging tests

# Frontend deployment
task deploy:frontend            # Deploy to Vercel

# Full deployment
task deploy                     # Deploy all applications

# Cloud Build triggers
task trigger:list              # List all triggers
task trigger:create            # Create new trigger
task trigger:delete            # Remove trigger
```

### Environment Configuration

#### Staging Environment
- **Service**: api-staging
- **Region**: us-central1
- **Port**: 3000 (BACKEND_PORT)
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop branches

#### Production Environment
- **Backend**: Cloud Run (api service)
- **Frontend**: Vercel
- **Database**: Cloud SQL
- **Storage**: GCS buckets

### GitHub Actions Integration
```yaml
# Manual staging test workflow
name: Test Staging Environment
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      test_suite:
        description: 'Test suite to run'
        required: true
        type: choice
        options:
          - all
          - staging-environment
          - staging-api
          - health-check
```

## Common Tasks

### Setting Up Cloud Build Trigger
1. Configure trigger in GCP Console or CLI
2. Set branch patterns (main, develop)
3. Configure substitution variables
4. Set Cloud Run service parameters
5. Test trigger with sample push

### Staging Deployment Process
1. Code pushed to main/develop
2. Cloud Build trigger activates
3. Docker image built and pushed
4. Cloud Run service updated
5. Integration tests run automatically
6. Deployment verification

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for deployment
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project
BACKEND_PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Docker Optimization
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for smaller images
FROM golang:1.21-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download
COPY . .
RUN go build -o api cmd/api/main.go

FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates
COPY --from=builder /app/api /api
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["/api"]
```

## Testing Strategies

### Staging Validation
```bash
# Run integration tests against staging
task deploy:staging:test

# Specific test suites
cd apps/backend/tests/integration
ginkgo run -tags=integration staging_api_test.go

# Health check verification
curl https://api-staging-xxxxx.run.app/health
```

### Deployment Verification
- Health endpoint responds 200 OK
- Firebase auth connects successfully
- Database migrations completed
- Environment variables loaded
- Logs show successful startup

## CI/CD Best Practices

### Build Optimization
- Use Docker layer caching
- Minimize image size
- Cache dependencies
- Parallel test execution
- Fail fast on errors

### Security Practices
- Never commit secrets
- Use Secret Manager for sensitive data
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Implement least privilege
- Audit deployment logs

### Rollback Strategy
- Keep previous versions available
- Tag releases appropriately
- Document rollback procedures
- Test rollback process
- Monitor post-deployment

## Integration Points

### With Test Validation Agent
- Run tests before deployment
- Validate staging after deployment
- Ensure quality gates pass

### With Go API Agent
- Coordinate API changes
- Update deployment configs
- Handle migrations

## Quality Standards

- Zero-downtime deployments
- Automated rollback capability
- Comprehensive deployment logs
- Environment parity (staging/prod)
- Security scanning enabled

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Manual deployment steps
- Hardcoded secrets
- Missing health checks
- Skipping staging validation
- Ignoring deployment failures

## Test Validation Requirement

**MANDATORY**: Before any deployment, run `task test:unit` and `task test:integration`. After staging deployment, run `task deploy:staging:test` to validate. No deployment is complete until all tests pass with exit code 0.
