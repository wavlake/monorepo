# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Maintaining This Documentation

**Any architectural changes, dependency updates, or significant alterations made to this repository MUST be reflected in this CLAUDE.md file.** This includes:

- New tools, libraries, or dependencies added to the project
- Changes to build processes, testing workflows, or development commands
- Modifications to the monorepo structure or file organization
- Updates to deployment processes or environment configurations
- Changes to type generation systems, authentication flows, or core APIs
- New development patterns, testing approaches, or quality gates

**This documentation serves as the primary reference for understanding the codebase and must remain current and accurate.**

## 🧪 CRITICAL: Test Validation Requirement

**MANDATORY TEST VALIDATION**: After any code changes or test modifications made by Claude, the ultimate task item must be to ensure all tests are passing. If tests are not passing, Claude must address the failures before considering the work complete.

**Test Validation Process**:
1. **After any code change**: Run appropriate test suite (`task test:unit:backend` for backend, `task test:unit:frontend` for frontend)
2. **After any test modification**: Verify all tests pass with `task test:unit` or `ginkgo run`
3. **Before marking tasks complete**: Confirm test suite passes with exit code 0
4. **On test failures**: Identify root cause and fix failing tests immediately
5. **Quality gate**: No work is considered complete until all tests pass

**Test Commands for Validation**:
```bash
# Backend changes - run backend tests
task test:unit:backend        # Unit tests with coverage
ginkgo run ./internal/...     # Specific package tests

# Frontend changes - run frontend tests  
task test:unit:frontend       # Frontend test suite

# Full validation after major changes
task quality:check            # Comprehensive: lint + test + coverage + build
```

**This requirement ensures code quality, prevents regressions, and maintains the TDD-focused development approach of this monorepo.**

## ⚠️ API Migration Status

**IMPORTANT**: The monorepo backend is a simplified implementation compared to the original `/dev/wavlake/api`. See `apps/backend/MIGRATION.md` for a comprehensive analysis of missing functionality including:

- **Advanced Audio Processing**: Multi-format compression, custom bitrates, quality controls
- **Track Processing Pipeline**: Webhook integration, status monitoring, Cloud Function automation  
- **File Server Operations**: Upload/download endpoints, mock storage for development
- **Enhanced Legacy Endpoints**: Artist/album track relationships, advanced PostgreSQL features

**Impact**: Core functionality works, but advanced features and development workflow improvements are missing. Refer to MIGRATION.md for implementation roadmap and priorities.

## Project Overview

This is a TDD-focused monorepo for Wavlake's decentralized music platform, featuring:
- **React TypeScript frontend** (Vite + Tailwind CSS) deployed to Vercel
- **Go backend API** with Firebase integration deployed to GCP Cloud Run  
- **Nostr relay integration** for decentralized features
- **Automatic TypeScript type generation** from Go structs
- **Comprehensive testing setup** across all layers

## Essential Commands

### Quick Start
```bash
task setup           # Initialize entire monorepo (dependencies + types + tests)
task dev:tdd         # Start development with test watchers
```

### TDD Workflow (Core Development Pattern)
```bash
task tdd             # Start test watchers for frontend + backend
task red             # Helper for creating failing tests
task green           # Run fast tests to verify implementation
task refactor        # Run tests + linting after code improvements

# Individual test suites
task test:unit:fast  # Quick feedback loop (no coverage)
task test:unit       # Full unit tests with coverage
task test:integration # Integration tests with Docker services
task test:e2e        # End-to-end Playwright tests
```

### Type Generation (Critical for Development)
```bash
task types:generate  # Generate TypeScript from Go structs
task types:watch     # Auto-regenerate on Go file changes
```

### Service Management
```bash
task dev:frontend    # React dev server only
task dev:backend     # Go API server only  
task dev:relay       # Local Nostr relay only
task dev:services    # All services without test watchers
```

### Quality Gates
```bash
task quality:check   # Comprehensive: lint + test + coverage + build
task coverage        # Generate coverage reports for both apps
task build           # Production builds (requires tests to pass)
```

## Architecture & Key Systems

### Monorepo Structure
- `apps/web/` - React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS (web client)
- `apps/backend/` - Go API with Firebase Admin SDK
- `packages/shared-types/` - Generated TypeScript interfaces + Nostr types
- `packages/dev-relay/` - Local Nostr relay configuration
- `tools/` - Development utilities and scripts

### Type Generation System
**Critical for maintaining type safety between Go and TypeScript:**

1. **Source**: Go structs in `apps/backend/internal/{models,handlers}/`
2. **Tool**: Tygo library (github.com/gzuidhof/tygo) configured via `apps/backend/tygo.yaml`
3. **Output**: TypeScript interfaces in `packages/shared-types/api/`
4. **Usage**: Frontend imports from `@shared` alias

**Process**:
- Analyzes Go structs and JSON tags using tygo
- Generates separate files: `models.ts` (data structures) and `handlers.ts` (requests/responses)
- Handles custom type mappings (time.Time → string, uuid.UUID → string, etc.)
- Auto-generates `index.ts` that re-exports all types
- Build process ensures types are current before deployment

**Configuration**: Types are generated based on tygo.yaml:
- Models package: `internal/models` → `api/models.ts`
- Handlers package: `internal/handlers` → `api/handlers.ts` (filters for *Request and *Response structs)
- Cross-references appear as `any /* models.TypeName */` but work correctly when imported

### Testing Architecture
**Backend (Go + Ginkgo)**:
- Mock generation with `//go:generate mockgen` directives
- Test services: Firebase emulators, test database, local relay
- Integration tests tagged with `// +build integration`
- **IMPORTANT**: Run backend test suite after any backend changes: `task test:unit:backend`

**Frontend (Vitest + React Testing Library)**:
- Component tests with user event simulation
- MSW for API mocking
- Playwright for E2E testing
- **IMPORTANT**: Run frontend test suite after any frontend changes: `task test:unit:frontend` (suite to be implemented)

**Test Services (Docker Compose)**:
- Firebase emulators (Auth, Firestore, Storage) on ports 9099, 8080, 9199
- Local Nostr relay on port 10547
- Test PostgreSQL database on port 5433

### Nostr Integration
Custom event kinds for music platform:
- Standard: User profiles (0), Text notes (1), Contacts (3)
- Music: Track metadata (31337), Albums (31338), Artists (31339), Playlists (31340)
- Payments: Lightning invoices (40001-40004)

Type definitions in `packages/shared-types/nostr/events.ts` include full NIP compliance.

### Pre-commit Workflow
Automated via `tools/scripts/pre-commit.sh`:
1. Regenerates types if Go structs changed
2. Runs linting and formatting
3. Executes fast tests
4. Validates builds
5. Scans for sensitive data

Install with: `task hooks:install`

## Development Patterns

### TDD Cycle Implementation
1. **Red Phase**: Use `task red` for test creation guidance
   - Backend: `ginkgo generate [package]` 
   - Frontend: Create `.test.tsx` files
2. **Green Phase**: Implement minimal code, verify with `task green`
3. **Refactor Phase**: Improve code, validate with `task refactor`

### Adding New API Endpoints
1. Define Go structs in `internal/models/` with JSON tags
2. Run `task types:generate` to update TypeScript interfaces
3. Frontend automatically gets type safety for new endpoints
4. Write tests first, then implement handlers
5. **Always run tests after changes**: `task test:unit:backend` for backend, `task test:unit:frontend` for frontend

### Working with Shared Types
- **Import**: `import { SomeType } from '@shared'` in frontend
- **Categories**: `api/` (generated), `nostr/` (manual), `common/` (utilities)
- **Regeneration**: Automatic on backend changes, manual with `task types:generate`

### Testing Requirements
**Critical**: Always run appropriate test suites after making changes:

**Backend Changes**:
```bash
task test:unit:backend        # Unit tests with coverage
task test:integration         # Integration tests (if applicable)
task deploy:staging:test      # Test against staging environment
```

**Frontend Changes**:
```bash
task test:unit:frontend       # Frontend test suite (to be implemented)
task test:e2e                 # End-to-end Playwright tests
```

**Full Validation**:
```bash
task quality:check            # Comprehensive: lint + test + coverage + build
```

## Environment Requirements

### Required Tools
- Node.js 18+ and Go 1.21+
- Task runner: https://taskfile.dev/
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Firebase CLI (for emulators)
- GCP CLI (for deployment)

### Environment Variables (.env.local)
```bash
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-gcp-project
DEFAULT_RELAY_URLS=ws://localhost:10547,wss://relay.wavlake.com
```

### Coverage Targets
- Backend: 80%+ unit test coverage
- Frontend: 75%+ component coverage
- Integration: 60%+ critical path coverage
- E2E: 90%+ user journey coverage

## Deployment Pipeline

### Automatic Deployment (GCP Cloud Build Triggers)
**Backend Staging**: Automatic deployment via GCP Cloud Build trigger
- **Trigger**: Pushes to `main` or `develop` branches with changes in `apps/backend/**`
- **Process**: `cloudbuild-staging.yaml` → Docker build → Cloud Run deployment → Integration tests  
- **Staging URL**: Auto-generated, accessible via `task deploy:staging:test`
- **Management**: `task trigger:list`, `task trigger:create`, `task trigger:delete`

### Manual Deployment Commands
- **Frontend**: `task deploy:frontend` → Vercel
- **Backend**: `task deploy:backend` → GCP Cloud Run  
- **Staging**: `task deploy:staging` → Manual staging deployment with tests
- **Full**: `task deploy` → Both applications

### CI/CD Features
- **Unit Tests**: Run automatically before deployment
- **Integration Tests**: Execute against deployed staging environment
- **Smoke Tests**: Basic health checks post-deployment
- **Build Caching**: Docker layer caching for faster builds
- **Environment Variables**: Automatic staging environment configuration

### Manual Testing
- GitHub Actions workflow for manual staging tests: `workflow_dispatch`
- Test suites: `all`, `staging-environment`, `staging-api`, `health-check`
- Custom staging URL testing support
